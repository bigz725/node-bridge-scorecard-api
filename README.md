# node-bridge-scorecard-api

This is a Node/ExpressJS/MongoDB backend app that keeps track of bridge scores.  I'm mostly using it to learn those technologies, as it's likely that an actual cloud-based scorecard app would not be allowed at ACBL sanctioned bridge games.  It could be used for collusion.
